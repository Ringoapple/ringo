<h2>Early life</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Sheena" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Sheena</a> was born with an esophageal atresia in which the esophagus narrows as it approaches the stomach. Treatment of this involved several operations, at least one of which required her right shoulder blade to be cut open. These surgeries left Sheena with <strong>large <u>scars</u></strong> on her shoulder blades, said to give the impression that an angel's wings had been removed.
